# ExecutionDeadline

Odds are, you should never ever, ever, use Ruby's built in timeout module
unless you are 100% certain the wrapped code may be interrupted at any point.
This gem provides a way to easily identify safe breakpoints for timeout
operations.

Usage of this gem should be combined with [the-ultimate-guide-to-ruby-timeouts](https://github.com/ankane/the-ultimate-guide-to-ruby-timeouts)
to ensure your application releases resources from otherwise stuck threads.

## Why use deadlines?
[gRPC and Deadlines](https://grpc.io/blog/deadlines/)


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'execution_deadline'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install execution_deadline

## Usage

### Deadline Enforcement

Deadlines are enforced only at breakpoints in the code specifically marked as
safe to error. This is most easily done with the simple method wrappers
provided in ExecutionDeadline::Helpers.

#### Examples

```ruby
class SlowClass
  extend ExecutionDeadline::Helpers

  deadline in: 1
  def perform
    sub_method_1
    sub_method_1
    method_never_called
  end

  deadline runs_for: 0.6
  def sub_method_1
    sleep 0.7
  end

  def method_never_called; end
end

instance = SlowClass.new
instance.perform # Throws OutOfTime error since sub_method_1 takes 0.6s of
                 # the total allowed 1s execution time. Since only 0.4s
                 # is left, the second execution of sub_method_1 is prevented
```

When calculating time left after the execution of a method the actual execution
time of the method is used. Consider the above example, but with a shorter
actual execution time.

```ruby
class ThinksItsSlowClass
  extend ExecutionDeadline::Helpers

  deadline in: 1
  def perform
    sub_method_1
    sub_method_1
    method_never_called
  end

  deadline runs_for: 0.6
  def sub_method_1
    sleep 0.1
  end

  def method_is_called
    :abcd
  end
end

instance = SlowClass.new
instance.perform # No errors are thrown and :abcd returned. Even though
                 # sub_method_1 says it will take 0.6 seconds, it actually
                 # takes 0.1 seconds. The second execution of sub_method_1 is
                 # checked against the remaining 0.9s, and allowed to continue
```

Deadlines are also usable on class methods and module methods.

```ruby
class SlowClass
  extend ExecutionDeadline::Helpers

  deadline in: 1
  def self.perform
    sub_method_1
    sub_method_1
    method_never_called
  end

  deadline runs_for: 0.6
  def self.sub_method_1
    sleep 0.7
  end

  def self.method_never_called; end
end

SlowClass..perform # Throws OutOfTime error

module SlowModule
  extend ExecutionDeadline::Helpers

  deadline in: 1
  def self.perform
    sub_method_1
    sub_method_1
    method_never_called
  end

  deadline runs_for: 0.6
  def self.sub_method_1
    sleep 0.7
  end

  def self.method_never_called; end
end

SlowModule.perform # Throws OutOfTime error
```

### Raised Errors
`ExecutionDeadline::OutOfTime` - Raised when a deadlined method is called but
  there is less time left then the expected runtime.

`ExecutionDeadline::DeadlineExceeded` - Raised when a deadlined method is
and completed after the deadline time has passed.

All errors are subclasses of `ExecutionDeadline::DeadlineError`

#### Customizing Errors

The errors raised may be customized using the `raises` keyword. The error to be
raised may _only_ be set when the deadline is defined (using the `in` keyword)

```ruby
module SlowModule
  class CustomError < StandardError; end
  extend ExecutionDeadline::Helpers

  deadline in: 1, raises: CustomError
  def self.runs_out_of_time
    sub_method_1
    sub_method_1
    method_never_called
  end

  deadline runs_for: 0.6
  def self.sub_method_1
    sleep 0.8
  end

  deadline in: 1, raises: CustomError
  def self.runs_over_time
    runs_over
    method_never_called
  end

  deadline runs_for: 0.5
  def self.runs_over
    sleep 1.1
  end

  def self.method_never_called; end
end

SlowModule.runs_out_of_time # Throws CustomError error in place of OutOfTime
SlowModule.runs_over_time # Throws CustomError error in place of DeadlineExceeded
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
